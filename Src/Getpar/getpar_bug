Rob,

     I think there is an bug in the new version of getpar.  I 
   couldn't get booleans read from a par file without specifying
   boo=1, or boo=0.  From dbx, it looks like booleans are returned
   from the par file with a '\n' appended to the name.  Its an easy 
   fix in gp_do_par_file, adding a test for '\n' for the end of name.
   Line 421.
